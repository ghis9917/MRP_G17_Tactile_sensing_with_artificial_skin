Shape not a gaussian, but for now it-s ok, not for the final project, no more constraints of the grid of course, and cover a 3D object (nn has to be able to generalize to these cases too)
Start from a real classes ae real knife and create classes from them, so we are sure to be able to can classify.
They doesn't care about the position/orientation of the interaction, ok to work with dangerous/safe.
Ae. classes, someone is guiding you, is pushing you, is punching... 
Human-robot interaction, hitting something, they want very specific amd realistic class, I've hit something, I'm stuck, I've a backpack, (how can we simulate a backpack...)
Start with a small classes, then try to expand their number
Take into account the computational complexity to decide how much realistic the interaction need to be
Create examples also without any intraction but only noises to consider the backgorund noise, no contact state
Classes' ideas from Rico&Likas:
Punch
Open hand
Band
Wire
Hit
finger
scratching

No more than 40 sensors, area of (look at the file on teams)

Next week meeting 16:00
