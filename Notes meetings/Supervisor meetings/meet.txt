- Focus on nn architectures that could fit
- How to accelerate the training, transfer learning, other datasetss...
- Focus on the skin model, sensor placement (try different pattern/placement) and density, how get data ec.
- Class we want to classify, not only danger/not, look at other research or dataset
- Maching online and offline training
- We don't have a good conclusion
- Which limits does our approach have? Max range, damages
- How many types of touches we want to classify? Type vs Location
- Type and property the parts of the skin we want to model (clearly defined)
- Variability and reliability of this approach (generalizable?)

* next meeting by 2-3 weeks
